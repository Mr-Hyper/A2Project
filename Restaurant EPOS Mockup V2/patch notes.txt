*Added:*
- Pure mockup that mocks core functionality of proposed solution
- Ability to add customer order:
   - Select quantity of items to add to customer order
   - Displays only starters (final will have every dish to select)
   - Customer order being currently created displayed on side of window
   - Ability to remove certain items from the order when creating the orders
   - Submitting order saves the order as a .txt file in a certain directory (final          will have a choos your own directory to save to)
   - Submitting order will show a message pop up saying that the order has          been sent to kitchen (really hasn't but it just says it for future iteration)
